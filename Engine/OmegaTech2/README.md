## Getting Started

To use the OmegaTech Game Engine, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
   - C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
   - raylib library (version 4.5.0 or later)
   - Preferably a Linux System
   - [Download raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

2. **Clone the repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   clone https://github.com/PixelPhobicGames/OmegaTech/
   ```

3. **Build the engine**: Use your preferred C compiler to build the game engine. For example, with GCC, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

   ```shell
   make
   ```

   This command compiles the main source file (`main.c`) with raylib linked.

4. **Run the game**: After successfully building the engine, execute the game binary to launch the sample game:

   ```shell
   ./OmegaTech
   ```

5. **Explore the code**: Open the project in your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to explore and modify the source code according to your needs.

6. **Start developing**: Customize the game by modifying the source code. You can create new levels, implement game mechanics, and more.
7. **Note**: Make sure GameData Folder and Engine Executable are in the Same folder.
